## Getting Started

These instructions show you how to get started using our example project provided.

### Prerequisites
This project uses Java to run the tests and framework, and Docker to build the isolated enviornment for each test.

Below are the version requirements:

- Docker (1.12.0 or greater)
- Docker Compose (1.7.0 or greater)
- Java JDK (version 1.8.0 or greater)


## Project Setup
You will need to do four things to use this framework:
1.  [Setup a gradle or maven project with the library set.]()
2.  Make sure your upstreams are defined in a separate file (or better yet directory).
3.  Configure `snow-globe.yml`
4.  Write your tests.
