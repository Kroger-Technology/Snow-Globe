# Setting up your project

These tests are written in Java.  To properly use this, we recommend that you setup a maven or gradle project.  If you are unsure how to do this, copy the `exampleUsage` folder and you can start from there.

## How do I setup a Java Project!?!

The easiest way is to copy paste.  [You can download an example project here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Kroger-Technology/Snow-Globe/tree/master/exampleUsage)  More information on the example project [can be found here.](https://github.com/Kroger-Technology/Snow-Globe/tree/master/exampleUsage)

## I got this Java thing.

If you are confident about setting up your own project, then you want to add in the snow-globe library as part
of your tests dependency.  The latest version is here:
